Bellabeat Case Study - Data Analytics Project
As part of my Google Data Analytics Certificate, I completed a case study analyzing Bellabeat's user data to demonstrate my data analytics skills and apply what Iâ€™ve learned. The goal was to provide business insights and explore potential new markets for the company.
# Key Steps and Tools:

    # Google Sheets:
  Introduced the company and study scope.
  Cleaned the data, performed descriptive statistics, created key metrics, and visualized variables using pivot tables.
  Compared Bellabeat's data with WHO metrics to propose potential new markets.
    # SQL (BigQuery):
   Imported data, merged tables, and calculated summary statistics and correlations to uncover trends in user behavior.
    # R:
    Installed required packages, uploaded and cleaned data, and created summary statistics and visualizations to further explore user insights.
    ---->This project not only showcases my technical proficiency but also highlights my ability to derive meaningful insights and make data-driven recommendations for business growth<---.
