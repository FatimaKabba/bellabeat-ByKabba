📊 Bellabeat Case Study - Showcasing My Data Analytics Skills
This project was part of my Google Data Analytics Certificate and aimed to analyze Bellabeat's user data to demonstrate my proficiency in data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization. The goal was to provide actionable insights and explore potential new markets for Bellabeat.
🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
    🧹 Tools: Google Sheets, SQL (BigQuery), R
    I removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized formats to ensure clean, reliable data for analysis.
2. Descriptive Statistics & Analysis
    📊 Tools: Google Sheets, SQL, R
    I used descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.) to explore patterns in the data. This included analyzing key metrics such as physical activity, sleep quality, and usage trends.
    In SQL, I wrote queries to calculate summary statistics and correlations to find relationships between variables.
3. Data Visualization
    📈 Tools: Google Sheets, R
    I created visualizations to make complex data easier to interpret, including pivot tables and charts that showed trends like usage peaks and patterns by age group.
4. Comparative Analysis
    🌍 I compared Bellabeat’s internal metrics with World Health Organization (WHO) data to provide strategic insights for exploring potential new markets.
